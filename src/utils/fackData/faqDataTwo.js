        question: "What is project scheduling in construction?",
        ans: "The foundation of any road is the subgrade, which provides a stable base for the road layers above. Proper compaction of the subgrade is crucial to prevent settling and ensure long-term road stability. Compaction involves using heavy machinery to compress the soil and create a solid foundation."
